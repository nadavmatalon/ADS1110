/* 
  ADS1110 LIBRARY - BASIC DEVICE TESTING EXAMPLE
  ----------------------------------------------
  
  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch offers a quick & simple code for testing that the ADS1110 is hooked-up and operating correctly.

  The sketch begins by searching for the ADS1110 on the I2C Bus. I then moves on to get the content of the data and configuration registers 
  available from the device.
  
  INPORTANT: The ADS1110 library depends on the Arduino IDE's native 'Wire' library for I2C communication between the Arduino (Master) and the ADS1110 (Slave),
  so it is __necessary__ to have it installed prior to using the current libraty.

                                       ADS1110
                                       -------
    (to Positive Input: 0V-VCC)  V+ --| â€¢     |-- V- (to GND / 2.048V Reference / 'Negative' Input 0V-VCC)
                                      |       |
                                GND --|       |-- VCC
                                      |       |
                                SCL --|       |-- SDA
                                       -------

  PIN 1 (Vin+) - Connect to voltage source to be measured
  PIN 2 (GND)  - Connect to Arduino GND
  PIN 3 (SCL)  - Connect to Arduino PIN A5 with a 2K2 pull-up resistor
  PIN 4 (SDA)  - Connect to the Arduino's PIN A5 with a 2K2 pull-up resistor
  PIN 5 (VCC)  - Connect VCC to Arduino 5V output
  PIN 6 (Vin-) - Connect Vin- either to Arduino GND (for Single-Ended voltage readings ranging 0-2.048V) or to an external 2.048V reference source 
                (for Single-Ended voltage readings ranging 0-4.096V) or to 'negative'* input (for differential voltage readings between positive 
                and 'negative' inputs).
  DECOUPING: Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the ADS1110's VCC & GND PINS.
  
  *Note: The 'negative' of input Vin- is put in brackets here because it actually differential in nature and not a so-called real negative voltage, 
         that is, it's negative only with relation to the positive input side of Vin+.

  I2C ADDRESSES
  -------------
  Each ADS1110 has 1 of 8 possible I2C addresses (factory hardwired & recognized by its specific part number & top marking 
  on the package itself):
 
    PART               DEVICE I2C ADDRESS          PART
   NUMBER           BIN        HEX        DEC     MARKING
  ---------       -------      ----       ---     -------

  ADS1110A1       1001001      0x49       73        ED1
