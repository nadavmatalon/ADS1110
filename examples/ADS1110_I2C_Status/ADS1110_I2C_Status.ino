  ADS1110 LIBRARY - I2C COMMUNICATION STATUS STRING EXAMPLE
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch presents a minimal example of extending the ADS1110 Library to include an additional function for generating a printable 
  I2C Communications Status string which may be useful, for example, during debugging sessions.

  As can be seen in the sketch below, implementation of this extended functionality only requires adding a single 'include' to the code, namely: 
  to that of the relevant *.h file (ADS1110ComStr.h).
  
  Note that this functional extension does come at the cost of an increased memory usage, and therefore it seemed preferable to maintain it 
  as an optional add-on rather than include it in the core ADS1110 Library itself.

                                       -------
    (to Positive Input: 0V-VCC)  V+ --| â€¢     |-- V- (to GND / 2.048V Reference / 'Negative' Input 0V-VCC)
                                      |       |
                                GND --|       |-- VCC
                                      |       |
                                SCL --|       |-- SDA
                                       -------

  PIN 1 (Vin+) - Connect to voltage source to be measured
  PIN 2 (GND)  - Connect to Arduino GND
  PIN 3 (SCL)  - Connect to Arduino PIN A5 with a 2K2 pull-up resistor
  PIN 4 (SDA)  - Connect to the Arduino's PIN A5 with a 2K2 pull-up resistor
  PIN 5 (VCC)  - Connect VCC to Arduino 5V output
  PIN 6 (Vin-) - Connect Vin- either to Arduino GND (for Single-Ended voltage readings ranging 0-2.048V) or to an external 2.048V reference source 
                (for Single-Ended voltage readings ranging 0-4.096V) or to 'negative'* input (for differential voltage readings between positive 
                and 'negative' inputs).
  DECOUPING: Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the ADS1110's VCC & GND PINS.
  
  *Note: The 'negative' of input Vin- is put in brackets here because it actually differential in nature and not a so-called real negative voltage, 
        that is, it's negative only with relation to the positive input side of Vin+.

  I2C ADDRESSES
  -------------
  Each ADS1110 has 1 of 8 possible I2C addresses (factory hardwired & recognized by its specific part number & top marking 
  on the package itself):
 
    PART               DEVICE I2C ADDRESS          PART
   NUMBER           BIN        HEX        DEC     MARKING
  ---------       -------      ----       ---     -------
